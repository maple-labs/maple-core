                which is `(value * pointsMultiplier) % totalSupply()`.
             With a well-chosen `pointsMultiplier`, the amount losses that are not getting distributed
                in a distribution can be less than 1 (base unit).
             We can actually keep track of the undistributed losses in a distribution
                and try to distribute it in the next distribution.
